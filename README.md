# Slipspace

Slipspace is the Tali programming language's official package
manager. It is heavily predicated on the use of the IPFS
protocol and network, and uses Merkle DAGs to structure
and distribute Tali code.

There's something that just feels *right* about combining LISP
and IPFS - and Slipspace is the bridge that accomplishes that.

## Development Plan

Slipspace is still in the planning phase - after all, there
aren't even functional Tali implementations to speak of!

To give a rough outline of the plan for Slipspace, consider
a world where:

- a unique content address (CID) is derived for every function
- every namespace was a DAG built from the composition of
  CIDs
- namespaces are accessible and distributed via the global
  trustless CDN that is IPFS

If this excites you, then Slipspace is for you!
